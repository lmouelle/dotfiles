# dotfiles

This repository is frankly defunct. I was a loyal emacs user for years but eventually, for many reasons, decided to switch to vscode.
I don't really use most of the programs in this repo. The intent was to use GNU Stow for dotfile management but these days I rarely move between 
machines so there's less value in it.

However if you are interested in using emacs, or GNU stow, I hope you find this repo useful. And who knows, maybe I will reuse it in the future.
